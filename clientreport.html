  <h1>Client Report</h1>
  <p>To make my content for my website, I first looked at what a clothing brand's website typically includes. This often involves a strong visual identity, clear navigation, and engaging product displays. I used AI to make my products for me and the images of mountains I had taken myself on my phone. <br> To communicate with my developer, we used text message and he added me to the groupchat. This worked well because I could see everything that they are doing. <br> The developer did meet my expectations and the site turned out really nicely. <br> I think I will add more things to my site plan so it can be even more layed out for them and easier to follow. </p>

    <h1>Lead Developer</h1>
    <h2>For Elija Larson</h2>
    <p>To talk with my team, I got their phone numbers and I also put everything in the repository on line such as the site plan and job tasks. <br> I communicated with my client via email. There were a few issues with his site plan making it hard to follow, but in the end I got it to look like what he wanted. <br> I published it as shown in class and gave him the link to the website. <br> My experience with managing the site on github went well. I thought it was easy to use and reliable.</p>

  <div id="juniordeveloper1">
    <h1>Junior Developer 1</h1>
     <h2>For Ayden Kissell</h2>
    <p>For my first junior website, we communicated over text group chat which worked well and everyone got the information they needed. <br> I was told what subpage to make and saw the site plan that was easy to understand. <br> I think I contributed well by creating what was expected of me. <br> For this site I did have an issue with one of my images, but I found the mistake in my code and was able to fix it.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="juniordeveloper2">
    <h1>Junior Developer 2</h1>
     <h2>For Noah Mackay</h2>
    <p>For my second junior website, we also used text message and email to communicate and there wasn't any issues. <br> I was told what subpage to make and it was layed out for me in the site plan. <br> I was able to create my subpage and I think it turned out well. It was more difficult to make it since my lead developer hadn't done any html or css when it was due. <br> I didn't run into any issues with github.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="generalexperience">
      <h1>General Experience and Reflection</h1>
      <p>I think the most challenging part of this project, was having to communicate effectively with everyone and try to understand what they wanted me to make. I went out of my way to be more talkative and figure out what they wanted from me. <br> I think the part that I enjoyed the most was to be able to see the site plan and then be able to make it happen, especially when I had never coded before the semester started. <br> If I was to do anything differently, I think I would have done everything more spread out than trying to do everything at once. <br> I feel a lot more confident now that I know the basics and then can use other tools like AI to make more complicated things.</p>
